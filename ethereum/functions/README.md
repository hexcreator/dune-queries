# Find Function Calls
ðŸ”— https://dune.com/queries/2330700

Using v2 Dune SQL, you can find function calls. In the query above, I find all Uniswap NFT Aggregator `execute(bytes,bytes[])` calls that start with a `Seaport` command. Technique:

1. Scan `traces` table to find all transactions sent to the Uniswap NFT Aggregator at 0xEf1c6E67703c7BD7107eed8303Fbe6EC2554BF6B.
2. Filter all txs that start with the bytes `0x24856bc3`, which is the `execute(bytes,bytes[])` function signature. [Get sigs here.](https://piyolab.github.io/playground/ethereum/getEncodedFunctionSignature/)
3. Filter all successful txs.
4. Filter by seaport command.
5. Limit to the first 100 results.

v2 Dune SQL is 1-indexed and `bytearray_substring(expression, start, length)` takes a subtring from a byte array. Each index is a byte - index 1 represents the first byte, index 2 represents the second byte, and so on. Bytes 1-4 contain the function signature in the `data` or `input` field for transactions. In the case of the Uniswap NFT Aggregator, the flow fires `execute` first; followed by calls to `dispatch` per inputted command. At `dispatch`, `Command` values determine which branch of code will execute. The list of commands can be found on their Etherscan or Github source. Seaport happens to be `0x10`, which is where that value comes from.
